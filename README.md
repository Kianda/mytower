# mytower
The same as containrrr/watchtower

Just built with a different name to prevent HomeAssistant unhealthy status.

It seems that "containrrr/watchtower" is not allowed on HA but It's possible to bypass this just having the same image with another name.

TIP: To prevent issues on HA remember to set the environment variable "[WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/arguments/#filter_by_enable_label)"
